## What is MovieStats?
MovieStats is a site which provides data about movies, actors and genres, as well as statistical connections between them.
This was the end project of the course "Data Based Systems - 0368-3458-01
" I did at Tel-Aviv University 

## Movies
After searching for a movie, you will be lead to a page with all corresponding results:

Each movie has its own page:

And recommended movies based on similar actors:
